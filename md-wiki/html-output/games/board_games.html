<p>I also like to play <a href="/home/r0m/projects/md-wiki/html-output/games/board_games.html">board games</a>, and we always play as many as we can when at <a href="/home/r0m/projects/md-wiki/html-output/games/home.html">home</a>. My friend Ort is an absolute board game hoarder, so he's got every game you could ask for. Some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dune - I love Dune, and the story is captured exceedingly well in this game. It has all of my favorite mechanics: bidding, bluffs, strategy, alliances, social deception, and a complex set of asymmetrical factions.</li>
<li>Spirit Island - An epic team game. We don't get that many co-op games with Ort, but this one is awesome. It is a really fun and satisfying experience, though I have only had the chance to play it a couple of times</li>
<li>Terra Mystica - I really like this game. The vibes and mechanics gel very well for my fantasy loving brain.</li>
</ul>
