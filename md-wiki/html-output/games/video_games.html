<p>I play a lot of video games, but some are played a lot more than others. Here are some of my top picks.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CS2</strong> - This is the go-to with all of my friends. I absolutely suck, but it can be a lot of fun playing in the competitive environment with everyone, as long as no one is taking it too seriously (sometimes an issue)</li>
<li><strong>Lethal Company</strong> - This game is goated, but we play it a lot less than we should.</li>
<li><strong>Stellaris</strong> - Haven't been on that grind recently, but what a GOAT. I have spent a lot of hours in this game and I love the modded scene.</li>
<li><strong>Minecraft</strong> - Everything that can be said has been.</li>
</ul>
