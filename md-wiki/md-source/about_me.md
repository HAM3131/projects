# About Henry Manning

I am a software engineer working in Cyber, but I am interested in all sorts of other things and fun activities. I love board games, video games, politics, church, and my girlfriend <3.

This is one of the many random software projects that I like to occupy myself with in my free time. If I like the results, I will end up using it as a template to create my own wiki page about all the fun stuff I do, and any opinions I have.
