# Board Games

I also like to play board games, and we always play as many as we can when at home. My friend Ort is an absolute board game hoarder, so he's got every game you could ask for. Some of my favorites:

 - **Dune** - I love Dune, and the story is captured exceedingly well in this game. It has all of my favorite mechanics: bidding, bluffs, strategy, alliances, social deception, and a complex set of asymmetrical factions.
 - **Spirit Island** - An epic team game. We don't get that many co-op games with Ort, but this one is awesome. It is a really fun and satisfying experience, though I have only had the chance to play it a couple of times
 - **Terra Mystica** - I really like this game. The vibes and mechanics gel very well for my fantasy loving brain.
